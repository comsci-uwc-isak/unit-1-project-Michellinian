Class 1: 
First we did a short warm up of identifying the input/output and the steps of the program, which led to our final task for unit 1 which is to create a car rental program. We tried to link the context of the program with the syllabus 1.1.1. Today
I learned what input ad output was, and I was able to identify them. Also I understood the Car rental app.

Class 2: 
Today we took our first step to creating the car rental app. Our first step was to create an install program. Essentially 
this program creates a folder "CarRentalApp", in the desktop, and inside that folder it automatically creates another folder which
are "db", short for database, and "scripts". This time. Dr. Pinzon, went through with us the whole process, so I had no difficulty 
understanding.

Class 3: 
After we created the install.sh, we made another program which was called the "frame". In this program, a message is supposed 
to show up when a certain code is executed. And the message is supposed to appear inside a box, that we also create within the 
program "frame". 
ex. 
*******************************************
*                                         *
*                 Welcome !               *
*                                         *
*******************************************
I had a hard time coding this, because it was somewhat complicating. I had to use a lot of seperate if statements, in the program
which made me confused. Maybe because I did without comments that made it harder for me to look at the codes. Next time I will
add some comments inside the code, so that it's easy for me to code, and also for other people to see my code.

Class 4: 
Today we created "create.sh" and "record.sh". The first one is supposed to create a car, with the arguments that the user types
in. The user should type in "licensePlate, Model, Color, numberOfPassengers", and the create.sh should store that value in the 
maincarfile.txt, which is created inside the db folder. Then there is the record.sh where it creates a .txt file accordingly 
to the cars license plate. Meaning, it creates an individual .txt file for each car, storing the information, "km, startOfTrip 
, endOfTrip", whch are typed as arguments from the users. I managed to understand the code, although I didn't know how to connect 
these two programs. I couldn't figure out, how to create a file of an individual car. Whenever I execute "bash record.sh",
it always says, "File not found!", and I need help with how to fix this error.

Class 5: 
During this class we first updated our car rental app repository. We identified our success criteria, and we also wrote about the
solution proposed. After that we did a short presentation about our assignments that the teacher gave us last lesson. We had 
to choose one of the four tasks, which were "edit, summary, delete, backup", I chose edit, although I couldn't cactually code
it, because I broke my computer. So I just summarized the steps of editting, and did a very brief presentation about it. I am 
planning on working with the code later in the day.
