Planning
----------
**Defining the Problem (Topic 1.1.1)**

The new system that we are going to create for the client is a program for recording information about the orders made by the customers. The car rental office would especially collect basic information about the distance driven for each car. This links with the syllabus 1.1.1 about "The context for which a new system is planned", because we are creating a new system of organizing car rental information. Since our client is a beginner in using computer, we need to create a program as simple as possible for our client. And while coding our program, we also need to think about the potential organizational issues that we will face through the process.
